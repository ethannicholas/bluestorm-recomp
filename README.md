# bluestorm-recomp

A static recompilation of *Wave Race: Blue Storm* (Nintendo GameCube, 2001) to native code.

The game's PowerPC executable is translated ahead of time into C, then compiled and linked
against a runtime that stands in for the GameCube hardware (graphics, audio, DVD, controllers,
memory card). The result is a native program that runs the original game logic without an
emulator's CPU core.

> **This repository contains no game code or data.** You must supply your own disc image,
> dumped from a copy of the game that you own. The build process reads the executable out of
> *your* image and recompiles it locally. Nothing derived from the game is distributed here.

## Legal

- *Wave Race: Blue Storm*, GameCube and all related names and marks are property of Nintendo.
  This project is not affiliated with or endorsed by Nintendo.
- This repository contains only original source code (the recompiler, the hardware/runtime
  layer and the renderer) plus metadata describing code layout (function addresses and
  names in `analysis/`). It contains no copyrighted game code, assets, BIOS/IPL files or
  DSP microcode.
- You need a legally obtained copy of the game. Dump it from your own disc using your own
  GameCube/Wii (e.g. with [CleanRip](https://wiibrew.org/wiki/CleanRip)). Do not download
  game images, and do not share the image, the extracted executable, the generated C code
  (`build/gen/`), built binaries, or memory card files, since all of these contain or are
  derived from the game.

## Status

Working:

- Boots, attract-mode movie (THP), title, menus, memory card save/load, character select,
  course flyovers and full races.
- Graphics: GX command processing, CPU-side transform and lighting, a generated TEV pixel
  pipeline (including indirect texturing), all texture formats, EFB copies and render-to-texture.
  OpenGL 4.1 renderer with a configurable internal resolution.
- Audio: AX DSP ucode (sound effects) and DVD-streamed music.
- Input: keyboard and any SDL-compatible gamepad.
- Memory card: emulated slot A card stored in `saves/memcard_a.raw`. You don't need to
  provide one: a blank, formatted card is created automatically the first time you run the
  game, and the game creates its save file on it as usual.

Known limitations:

- **macOS (Apple Silicon) only** for now. The code is portable C/C++ (SDL2 + OpenGL), but other
  platforms need an OpenGL loader and small platform shims.
- Runs at the game's native 30 fps (the simulation advances a fixed 1/30 s per frame).
- Accuracy is still being validated. Expect visual and audio differences from real hardware.

## Supported version

Only the North American release is supported:

| Title | Disc ID | `main.dol` SHA-1 |
|---|---|---|
| Wave Race: Blue Storm (USA) | `GWRE01` | `d500d8f5bab39ae5fed67d0a0864095a9ea190d9` |

The build verifies this hash and stops with an error for any other version.

## Building

### Requirements

- macOS on Apple Silicon
- Xcode (or the Command Line Tools), CMake 3.20+, Ninja, Python 3
- SDL2

With Homebrew:

```sh
brew install cmake ninja sdl2 python
```

### 1. Provide your game image

Dump your disc, then place the image in `rom/` as an **uncompressed `.iso`**:

```
rom/game.iso
```

If your dump is in a compressed format (`.rvz`, `.gcz`, `.ciso`), convert it to ISO first,
for example with Dolphin (right-click the game → *Convert File…* → *Uncompressed Disc Image*),
or with `dolphin-tool convert`, or [`nodtool`](https://github.com/encounter/nod):

```sh
cargo install --locked nodtool
nodtool convert "rom/Wave Race - Blue Storm (USA).rvz" rom/game.iso
```

The build uses the first `.iso` it finds in `rom/`. To use an image elsewhere, pass
`-DGAME_ISO=/path/to/game.iso` when configuring.

### 2. Build

```sh
./build.sh
```

The first run configures CMake, extracts `main.dol` from your image into `build/`, verifies it,
recompiles all 2,572 game functions to C (`build/gen/`) and builds the `build/waverace`
executable. Recompilation plus compilation takes well under a minute on a recent Mac.

### 3. Run

```sh
./build/waverace            # uses the configured image / rom/*.iso
./build/waverace path/to/game.iso
```

Run it from the repository root: the memory card is created in `saves/` relative to the
current directory. Like any save file, it contains data written by the game, so don't
share or commit it (`saves/` is git-ignored).

## Controls

| GameCube | Keyboard | Gamepad |
|---|---|---|
| Control stick | Arrow keys | Left stick |
| C-stick | – | Right stick |
| A | X | A (south) |
| B | Z | X (west) |
| X | C | B (east) |
| Y | S | Y (north) |
| Z | D | Right shoulder |
| L / R | Q / W | Left / right trigger |
| Start | Enter | Start |
| D-pad | I / J / K / L | D-pad |

Escape quits.

## Command-line options

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `--scale=N` | Internal render resolution multiplier (default 2) |
| `--hidden` | Don't show the window (testing) |
| `--headless` | Run without graphics or audio output |
| `--dump-dir=DIR --dump-every=N` | Save every Nth frame as a PNG |
| `--sample` | Print periodic profiling samples of what the game code is doing |
| `--log-all` | Verbose hardware logging |

Debugging environment variables used during development include `WR_INPUT` (scripted
controller input), `WR_GXSTATS`, `WR_TRACE_FRAME`, `WR_WAV` (record audio output) and
`WR_PEEK`. See the source for details.

                                                                              ├─> waverace

```

- **Recompiler** (`recomp/`): a Gekko (PowerPC 750CL with paired singles) to C translator.
  Function boundaries and jump tables come from
  [decomp-toolkit](https://github.com/encounter/decomp-toolkit) analysis (`analysis/symbols.txt`);
  every function becomes a C function operating on a CPU state struct. Indirect branches go
  through a lookup table; `recomp/patches.txt` can replace individual instructions.
- **CPU/OS** (`runtime/cpu.cpp`, `runtime/threads.cpp`): memory is a flat host allocation
  indexed by guest address. The game's own OS runs unmodified. Only context switching
  (`OSSaveContext`/`OSLoadContext`) is replaced: each guest thread runs on a host thread and
  resumes via `setjmp`/`longjmp`. Interrupts are delivered at loop back-edges.
- **Hardware** (`runtime/hw/`): register-level emulation of the processor interface, video
  interface, DVD interface, serial interface (controllers), EXI (IPL/RTC/SRAM, memory card),
  audio interface and DSP interface, with high-level emulation of the DSP's boot ROM, the AX
  audio ucode and the memory card unlock ucode.
- **Graphics** (`runtime/gx/`): the GX FIFO is parsed as the game writes it. Vertex transform,
  lighting and texture coordinate generation run on the CPU, and the per-pixel TEV stages are
  compiled into GLSL shaders. Draw batches are handed to an OpenGL renderer on the main thread.

## Tools

- `tools/fetch_dtk.sh`: downloads decomp-toolkit, used to regenerate `analysis/`
  (`dtk dol split analysis/config.yml analysis/out` after a build has produced `build/main.dol`).
- `tools/dis`: prints the disassembly of a function from dtk's output.
- `tools/contact.py`: tiles dumped frames into a contact sheet.
